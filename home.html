    <p> Sri Lanka boasts a remarkable array of endemic species, making it a biodiversity hotspot. The island's distinct ecosystems, from rainforests to dry zones, support a wealth of unique fauna found nowhere else on Earth. Notably, the purple-faced langur (Semnopithecus vetulus) is an iconic primate species endemic to Sri Lanka, primarily inhabiting the country's montane forests and exhibiting a striking appearance with its purple-hued face. 
    Additionally, the Sri Lankan leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya) stands as a flagship species endemic to the island, revered for its beauty and ecological significance. These endemic species face various threats, including habitat loss and human-wildlife conflicts, underscoring the importance of conservation efforts to safeguard their existence (Dissanayake, 2019).

        <p> Despite its incredible biodiversity, Sri Lanka faces numerous conservation challenges threatening its wildlife. 
        Habitat fragmentation, human-wildlife conflict, poaching, and illegal wildlife trade pose significant risks to various species. 
        Conservation initiatives and protected areas play a pivotal role in preserving Sri Lanka's wildlife. 
        The establishment of national parks and reserves such as,</p>
        <ul> 
            <li> Yala National Park</li>
            <li> Sinharaja National Park </li>
        </ul>
        <p>serves as critical havens for endangered species. Additionally, community-based conservation programs and awareness campaigns engage local communities in wildlife conservation, 
        fostering coexistence between humans and wildlife and promoting sustainable practices (Dissanayake, 2019; Ranawana et al., 2020).

        <h3><li> Marine Biodiversity</li></h3>
        <div class="sec1">
            <div class="homep">
                <p> The coastal waters surrounding Sri Lanka are teeming with diverse marine life, contributing significantly to the country's rich wildlife. This aquatic ecosystem hosts a myriad of species, including various fish, sea turtles, and marine mammals. 
                    The presence of endangered sea turtle species like the leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) and olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea) turtles highlights the ecological importance of Sri Lanka's coastlines as critical nesting sites. 
                    Moreover, the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), the largest animal on Earth, frequents these waters, attracting ecotourism and emphasizing the need for responsible conservation measures to protect these majestic creatures (Ranawana et al., 2020).
